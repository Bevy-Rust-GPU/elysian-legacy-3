* Refactor domain types as trait impls
  * Semantically similar to context, i.e. a set of types
  * Will avoid having to implement combinators over (Distance, D)
  * Should allow replacing (DistanceF32, (GradientF32, ()) with PosDistGrad
    * Feels like Input / Field / Output taking multiple values may complicate this

  DONE: Attempted, but ended up creating type aliases for lists,
        as Combine subtypes need to pattern-match an ADT in order to deconflict their impls

* Elide Input / Output / Field wrapping for API purposes
  * Structs still need to exist for ADT purposes
  * Need an ADT lifting function that can be called inside the Shr impl

  DONE: Implemented via shape builder wrapper and Shr operator

* Formalize rasterize, ascii, image, viuer into new ADT subtype
  * Interpreter is the wrong term
  * Semantically a Context -> Context operation
    * Similar to domain-lifted Input / Output / Field functions,
      and composable with them
  * Supertype of all existing ADT ops?
    * Devil's advocate says this is overcomplicated and should be omitted
      in favour of simple function composition
      * However, it's still useful as ADT for the following reasons:
        * Chaining multiple actions within a context (i.e. nesting inside Shape, Combine)
        * Use of output within a context
          * ex:
            Texture mapping via Raster + Uv + Color
            Conversion to a mesh for LOD / optimization purposes under software rasterization
            Rendering generated ascii as distance field characters
            Using texture lookup as an alternative to domain evaluation
        * Breaking specific entries out of a context to leave the ADT and continue via simple composition

  DONE: Implemented Modify as an ADT unit, but not useful for rasterize etc
        since they evaluate an ADT rather than modifying a context.
        However, this realizes Get, Set and related lifted functions as Modify subtypes.

* Make Combine operation types symbolic
  * Lift via trait, similar to domain functions
  * Allows the ADT to remain a Free structure
  * Allows formalization of interpreters over free structure

  DONE: Combine ops are now lifted into the register machine interpreter via the LiftCombine trait

* Strengthen Input / Field / Output encoding
  * Create specific traits to replace Domain
    * LiftInput / LiftOutput / LiftField
    * Allows relating of open symbol types to closed ADT wrappers
  * Feels like it relates to a prospective output type encoding,
    since the promise is that A flows through Inputs,
    is transformed into B by Field, then flows through Outputs
  
  DONE: Encoded via LiftAdt, since lifting into a wrapper and lifting into functions are distinct

* Parameter substitution for symbolic ADT inner types
  * Use functions instead of literals
    * Ex. Isosurface(Const(0.2)) instead of Isosurface(0.2)
  * Lift to context functions and evaluate as part of overall graph
  * Using functions allows arbitrary value transformation before use as input
  * Opens the door to functional reactive programming
    * Animation system by using time as a parameter
  * Can use Tagged types for named variables
    * ex. Tagged<ProjectionMatrix, Mat4> for raymarching, corresponding GetF<ProjectionMatrix>
    * May be able to replace DistanceF32 etc with true symbol types

  DONE: Parameters are now functions, and get lifted via LiftParam during evaluation

* ADT de/serialization via serde
  * Opens the door to an Elysian file type, FFI, etc

  DONE: Derived Serialize / Deserialize for all ADT structs and symbols

=======================================================================================================================

* Abstract over multi-frame evaluation
  * ex:
    Generating a series of images for ascii / viuer printing
    Generating an animated GIF for viuer printing
  * Can use a parameter function to retrieve time from context and parametrize

* Investigate Monad / Applicative instances for ADT
  * List is monadic, so the ADT should be too

* Investigate Semigroup / Monoid instances for ADT
  * Intuitive binary operation over shapes is Union

* Investigate refactoring LiftDomain and co into a State monad impl
  * Effectively equivalent - drags a state (i.e. context) through a chain of functions,
    which can be lifted to operate on the state
  * Haskell RWST transformer is of interest, if Elysian can be a Monad

* R&D for proxy application
  * Semantically, this is a combine operation that
    evaluates shapes A and B, and replaces or blends
    some subset of shape B's context into shape A's context
  * In theory, this is a superset of distance boolean / bounding operators
    i.e. Replacing distance in the case of regular boolean,
         and blending it in the case of smooth boolean

* Haskell diagrams R&D
  * Lots of food for thought in the documentation
    * https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/doc/quickstart.html
  * Raycast-based layout
  * Notion of local origin

* Formalize interpretation of free structure
  * Existing type-level register machine behaviour is an interpreter
  * Alternate interpreters:
    * Dynamic structuring
      * Convert ADT into a type-erased value-level equivalent (ex. dyn / impl Trait)
        * Useful for runtime editing,
          though may not be mandatory if strongly-typed recursive control flow is viable
    * EDSL graph visualizer
      * Create a new EDSL visualizing the graph as UI primitives
    * Graph optimizer
    * Bevy hierarchy generator
      * Interpret boolean union as breaking a child out of its parent hierarchy
    * Static evaluation
      * Pre-evaluate expensive operations
        * ex. Layout:
          Replace a Combine<A, B, AxialFit> with Combine<Shape<Translate, A>, Shape<Translate, B>, Union>
          * Where AxialFit is semantically equivalent to raycast-based layout from Haskell diagrams
          * This raises the question of how AxialFit relates to Union
            * Suggests the need for composable Combine subtypes?
              * Devil's advocate says this may be overkill,
                since ex. horizontal layout aims to avoid overlap
              * However, making it compositional strengthens semantics
                and eases implementation for coupled cases
                (i.e. via type alias or function call wrapping)
          * Code should be shareable between runtime and static evaluation

* ADT parsing via nom
  * Opens the door to creating a specialized CLI REPL
